Mark- setup database, bibmaint
Sky- print function, bibauthor, bibcontent, makefile





Bibmaint first tokenizes the identifier to determine what type of data to update or insert.
It then gets the pubid or aid, and queries the publication or author table to see if the data is present
Next, it parses the rest of the input, and does an insert or update to the correct table.
For publications, the new or updated record is printed similarly to bibcontent.
